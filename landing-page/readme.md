# Workcity Landing Page Overview

This folder contains a short explanation and screenshots of the landing page I built for the Workcity assessment.  
The page was created inside WordPress using Elementor on a clean installation running locally on workcity-assessmentcom.local.

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section
- Large headline: “Build Better Spaces for Work”  
- Supporting text explaining Workcity’s value.  
- Two call-to-action buttons: *Book a Tour* and *Contact Us*.  
- A full-width background image with a subtle overlay for readability.  
- Social icons (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) placed at the top right for brand visibility.

### 2. Services Section
- Section title: “Check out our range of services”  
- Short introductory description explaining the workspace options.  
- Three service cards:
  - Shared Workspaces  
  - Meeting Rooms  
  - Private Offices  
- Each card includes an icon, a heading, and a brief description.  
- Layout built using Elementor columns for a clean, balanced grid.

### 3. Testimonials Section
- Title: “What our members think about us”  
- Supporting text about reliability and ease of use.  
- Four testimonial cards with:
  - Member quote  
  - Name  
  - Company  
  - Placeholder profile icon  
- Cards are styled with soft shadows and padding to match a modern workspace aesthetic.

### 4. Contact Form Section
- Section title: “Request a call back?”  
- Short note explaining response time.  
- WPForms used for the form, as allowed in the brief.  
- Fields included:
  - First name  
  - Last name  
  - Email  
  - Message  
- Submit button styled to match the site’s color palette.

### 5. Footer Section
- Footer shows the WORKCITY brand name.  
- Simple one-sentence brand description.  
- Social media icons displayed again for consistency.  
- Clean, centered layout with ample padding.

## Tools and Plugins Used

- Elementor – for page structure and styling  
- WPForms – for the contact form  
- Google Analytics added manually inside the theme’s header.php file  
- LocalWP – used to run the local WordPress environment

## Notes

- All content was built directly inside the Elementor page (no reusable templates).  
- Layout is responsive and adjusts cleanly on tablet and mobile.  
- Images and spacing were optimized for readability.  
- GA4 tracking was added manually inside the theme’s header.php file before the closing </head> tag.
